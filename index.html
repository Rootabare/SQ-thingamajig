    <h3>↑ Who is this little fella ?</h3>

      <b>1. Who Is This Little Yellow Dragon?</b>
      <br />
      Name & Meaning His name is Nailong (奶龙), which translates to “Milk
      Dragon” in Chinese.
      <br />
      Nailong is a small, round, yellow dragon with a big head and tiny limbs.
      He has a cute, childlike face with large eyes and a wide smile. His design
      is simple yet endearing, making him instantly likable. Nailong’s
      personality is playful and mischievous, often getting into humorous
      situations that showcase his innocence and curiosity. It’s such an
      adorable and unexpected combo, right?
      <br />
      <br />
      Origin Story & Creator Nailong was created by Seventh Impression Culture &
      Media, a company based in Shenzhen, China. Designed by Lu Siying and
      conceptualized by Xie Cheng’en, he officially debuted on January 22, 2020,
      through short-form animation on Douyin (China’s TikTok) Dailymotion Unlike
      most mascots that begin with backstory and development, Nailong was
      originally designed to be a viral star—cute, round, and expressive—with no
      deep origin story needed. Later on, his adventures were expanded through
      short videos, often showing him in sci-fi escapades with a boy named Xiao
      Qi .

      <b>2. Chinese Mascot to Meme Icon</b>
      <br />
      2024–2025: Merchandise & Spread By 2024, Nailong was being sold as plush
      toys, featured in theme parks, and used in brand collaborations across
      China and Southeast Asia You’ve probably seen him in stores like Miniso,
      where he’s promoted as the newest adorable mascot in their plush lineup
      <br />
      <br />
      Rise as a Meme
      <br />
      On Douyin, one popular meme format showed two Nailongs facing off,
      declaring: "我是奶龙" (“I am Nailong”), complete with dramatic expressions
      and danceable sounds. These clips were perfect for remixes and spread like
      wildfire online Dailymotion
      <br />
      Global TikTok Explosion (Mid-2025) Nailong hit Western TikTok around late
      July 2025. A video by @angelbanglebagel amassed 3 million views in just a
      week, and another by @itsme_hiiyes featuring Nailong sticker GIFs reached
      9 million views Gucci Bucket Hat Meme By August, Nailong was the star of
      the “Gucci Bucket Hat” meme trend—where characters don bucket hats and
      dance along to the track “Gucci Bucket Hat” by Pap Chanel x Future. People
      loved seeing this cute squishy dino donning high-fashion vibes—and it
      exploded with views within days
